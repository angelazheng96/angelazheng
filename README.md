This is my personal website! It includes a bit about me, info about my projects, a fun blog, and pictures that I've taken. I made it so I can have somewhere to put random thoughts and tidbits that I'd like to share with the world. :)

## Development
Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), JavaScript, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in around 26 hours. It was my first time using both Astro and Tailwind CSS, so I was able to learn a lot!
