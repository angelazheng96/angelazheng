This is my personal website! It includes a bit about me, info about my projects, a fun blog, and pictures that I've taken. I made it so I can have somewhere to put random thoughts and tidbits that I'd like to share with the world. :)

## Development
Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS in around 26 hours. It was my first time using both of these, so I was able to learn a lot!

I struggled the most with Astro's image rendering for my gallery, as well as the sheer time required to learn Tailwind CSS. However, I'm glad that I spent the time customizing everything to my liking, even the littlest details, and I'm very happy with how it turned out!
