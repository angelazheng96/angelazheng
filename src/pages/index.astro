      Hi—welcome to my personal website! I'm Angela Zheng, an incoming Computer
      Science student at the University of Toronto (St. George), originally from
      Ottawa. I'm passionate about creating useful software that will help
      improve our world, even if it's just a silly game that makes someone's day
      a bit better. I'm super interested in anything related to CS, math, stats,
      physics, astronomy, and the like!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than this, I'm also a competitive figure skater and a former FRC and
      band kid. In my free time, I enjoy learning about random topics through
      YouTube rabbit holes, crocheting, reading books, and baking... along with
      lots of other occasional hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please feel free to connect with me through email or LinkedIn—I'd love to
      chat!
