      I'm a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto (St.
      George), originally from Ottawa. I'm passionate about creating useful
      software that will help improve our world, even if it's just a silly game
      that makes someone's day a bit better. I'm super interested in anything
      related to CS, math, stats, physics, astronomy, and the like!

      Other than this, I'm also a competitive figure skater and a former FRC and
      band kid. In my free time, I enjoy learning about random topics through
      YouTube rabbit holes, crocheting, reading books, and baking... along with
      lots of other occasional hobbies.
