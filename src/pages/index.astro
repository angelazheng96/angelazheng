      Welcome to my personal website!
    </h2>
    <div>
      Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Angela Zheng, a first-year Computer Science student at the
      University of Toronto (St. George), originally from Ottawa. I'm currently
      involved in UTMIST, CSSU, WISE, and UTAT at U of T in a variety of roles.
      I'm also super interested in anything related to CS, math, stats, physics,
      astronomy, and the like!

    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-eggplant dark:text-lilac">
      What else?
    </h2>
    <div>
      Other than the serious stuff, I'm a former competitive figure skater (yay
      synchronized skating!), member of FRC, and flute/piccolo player in band.
      In my free time, I enjoy learning about random topics through YouTube
      rabbit holes, crocheting, reading books, baking, eating good food,
      drinking bubble tea, and taking pictures of sunsets... along with lots of
      other occasional hobbies. Or, in emoji format: 💐💫🍓🧋🍵⛸️🎼🌌🌅📸📚🎶🧶
