# Overview
From the wonderful [OneTeamMVMT](https://www.oneteammvmt.org/pages/about-synchro):

> Synchronized skating is a team discipline of figure skating, where 8-20 skaters train and compete together, performing intricate steps and elements together, in perfect sync or syncopation, as part of a routine set to music. It is a unique blend of artistry and athleticism, combining speed, strength, and agility with grace, flexibility, and theatrical performance.
The main elements include: blocks, lines, intersections, circles, wheels, move elements, lifts, spins, and pair elements.


# My Experience
I started synchronized skating back in 2017 with [Starlight Synchro](https://www.starlightsynchro.com/), and continued every year until the 2024-2025 season! Going from the Pre-Juvenile category all the way to Intermediate (which got renamed to Gold) has taught me so much about skating better, navigating team dynamics, and being a leader.

We worked really hard and (somehow) medalled three times at Nationals! Silver in 2023 (Calgary), Gold in 2024 (Waterloo), and Bronze in 2025 (also in Waterloo) + I was one of the Co-Captains! Throughout these years, I've always loved getting to watch the Senior and Junior teams at competitions and spending hours in front of the TV during Worlds. Synchro is such a competitive, beautiful sport that continues to evolve faster and faster, leaving any audience member in awe of the skaters.

# Time for the Rankings!

## Disclaimer
These are just my personal favourite programs! There are so many awesome synchro teams out there—it's very difficult to pick the best ones. This is basically just me fangirling over these *insane* skaters.

1. ## "Breathe" | Helsinki Rockettes Senior (FIN) 2022-2023 Short Program

Such a cool opening, I LOVE the intersecting artistic wheel, the dresses are so intricately designed

In the music, they did a team recording session of their own breathing and added those recordings to the music!

All the choreography is super flowing and symmetrical, their no hold switch of spots with pivots in the lines are unmatched

The music perfectly builds especially the heavy breathing during the twizzles and whip, until all the tension is released in the artistic wheel

To this day I still odn't understand the collapsing square in the middle of the artistic wheel even htough I've watched it in slow motion 2943728729375 times.

I LOVE THIS PROGRAM


2. ## "Madame Butterfly" | Les Suprêmes Senior (CAN) 2022-2023 Free Program

An amazing program. So jealous of my friends who went to Lake Placid to watch this in-person also love the dresses

Fun fact: this program's music is one of the main ones that inspired us to make our synchro music playlist! Truly one of the programs I've watched the most of and listened to the most (shoutout to Good News by Apashe)

the drum beat is such a good base i LOVE this music

start of the half backward half forward pivot blocks


big switch into pure classical calm music but you can tell something is building up with the opera

crazy three shoot the ducks in a row in no hold

front somersaults in the artistic wheel

insane crazy stuff all around ending with the creative element to their ending

3. ## "Mount Everest" | Les Suprêmes Senior (CAN) 2023-2024 Free Program

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZvIP8uDY1I?si=SoD1kpZBS73jsuod" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Iconic just because it was their three-peat world champions program

The most iconic opening position trust fall, going straight into the creative element. I remember the first few comps when they didn't even get a creative element called because they weren't rotating the lifts, until they changed the choreography

intersecting shoot the ducks to y-scales with biellemanns to spiral duck unders

peak difficulty omg

the last minute change of pivot block lines to half backward half forward
wind gust blowing with lines gradually turning

SO MANY difficult elements just for funsies

shoot the ducks and falling leafs through a whip?

spot switch during cluster and drag turns (supremes style)


The most perfect music choices - building up to rap to finish off such a strong program

Ending with "I'm on top of the world" AS THEY THREE PEAT

4. ## "He Had It Coming" | Team Unique Senior (FIN) 2024-2025 Free Program

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvyywPtMaTA?si=vtdvhdMypbeFWtzc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

SO SHARPPPPP like the blade of a knife. the precision is unmatched. every single person has the perfect expression the SASS

that beginning. their necks moving in sync to the pops

opening w perfect twizzles in a circle

theri dresses are BEAUTIFULLL THAT LACE

THE MOST INSANE DEATH SPIRALS. wdym back cartwheel, counter, straight into a cross grab split death spiral into a split exit. literally perfect in sync how are they so flexible

such unique group lifts, never seen anything like it before

perfect pivot block in a triangle

perfect textbook whip on one foot too

personal pet peeve: can the crowd please learn how to clap on time

super upbeat no hold! like genuinely the perfect homage to the musical

iconic creative element with the four split lifts that really just remind me of a musical tehatre performance

they so deserved the free program win

# Synchro Music
My friend and I made a giant playlist (currently over 9 hours long), curating music from lots of synchro programs, both ones we've watched, ones we've skated, and ones we've competed against. Feel free to check it out!
