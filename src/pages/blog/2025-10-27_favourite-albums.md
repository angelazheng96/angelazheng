# *folklore* by Taylor Swift (2020)
THE album that got me into listening music and Taylor Swift. So much nostalgia for long walks outside during COVID, car trips to beach outings, and doing homework at my desk.

# *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)* by Taylor Swift (2010 / 2023)
The Taylor's Version with my favourite vault tracks. I learned how to play the backing to *When Emma Falls in Love* on piano and played it non-stop for months. Nostalgia for summer of 2023: a vivid memory of a car trip late in the evening, the sun already down, going home from a golf course.

# *reputation* by Taylor Swift (2017)
A classic. Even if we never get the vault tracks, I could listen to this non-stop. Again, nostalgic times during COVID when I would listen to reputation on loop on the way to beaches or parks. Super catchy beats that are actually the sweetest love songs (what I wish TLOAS was more like).

# *Wishbone* by Conan Gray (2025)
Such a screamable album!! Conan's vocals are insane here, all these songs sound amazing and the high note in *Vodka Cranberry* is just unmatched. I got tickets for the Wishbone Tour in February 2026!!! I *cannot* wait to watch Conan live!!!

# *Superache* by Conan Gray (2022)
Aching listening to *People Watching* and *Astronomy* in my newly bought wireless earbuds as I walked around my neighbourhood. I had already gotten into Conan Gray after discovering Kid Krow.

# *GUTS* by Olivia Rodrigo (2023)
Beginning of grade 11, listening to GUTS for the first time on the way to school. Perfectly captures teenage angst after SOUR, but in a more mature way. My favourites: *making the bed*, *the grudge*, *pretty isn't pretty*, and *teenage dream*. Special shoutouts to the singles *bad idea right?*, *vampire*, and *get him back!* for being amazing workout songs.

# *SOUR* by Olivia Rodrigo (2021)
The most perfect pop album. Listened non-stop to *drivers license*, *deja vu*, *good 4 u*, but also loved the teenage angst in *brutal* and *jealousy, jealousy*. The most beautiful ballads: *traitor*, *1 step forward, 3 steps back*, *enough for you*, *happier*, *favorite crime*, and *hope ur ok*. Truly no skips on this one.

# *A Matter of Time* by Laufey (2025)
*Tick, tock:* like clockwork, I was hypnotized by this album as soon as it came out. In the end, I'm just a *Lover Girl*, and feel life going around like a *Carousel*.

I saw this live on October 19th!!! Laufey is such an amazing live performer, the stage was so beautiful, and I got my first ever concert t-shirt! :D

# *Crush(ed)* by Katherine Li (2022)
This one was just a too relatable as I returned to school in grade 11 and it was all *Happening Again* (my most-streamed song in 2023). It all worked out in the end though! ;)
