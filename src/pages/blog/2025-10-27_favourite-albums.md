A journey through my favourite albums over the years, in chronological order of my listening. I apologize in advance for my bad song puns.

# *folklore* by Taylor Swift (2020)
THE album that got me into listening music and Taylor Swift. So much nostalgia for long walks outside during COVID, car trips to beach outings, and doing online school at my desk. One day, I swear I will crochet a *folklore* cardigan and relive my memories of the Eras Tour (from the movie theatre—we were not able to get tickets lol).

# *reputation* by Taylor Swift (2017)
A classic. Even if we never get the vault tracks, I could listen to this non-stop. Again, nostalgic times during COVID when I would listen to *reputation* on loop on the way to beaches or parks. Super catchy beats that are actually the sweetest love songs.

# *Kid Krow* by Conan Gray (2021)
I don't even remember how I heard about Conan Gray, but I remember listening to his music super often and finding his precious YouTube vlogs. Very specific memory of painting walls in a new house while listening to *Kid Krow* and *1989*.

# *SOUR* by Olivia Rodrigo (2021)
The most perfect pop album. Listened non-stop to "drivers license", "deja vu", "good 4 u", but also loved the teenage angst in "brutal" and "jealousy, jealousy". The most beautiful ballads: "traitor", "1 step forward, 3 steps back", "enough for you", "happier", "favorite crime", and "hope ur ok". Truly no skips on this one.

# *Superache* by Conan Gray (2022)
Aching listening to "People Watching" and "Astronomy" in my newly purchased wireless earbuds as I walked around my neighbourhood. I had already gotten super into Conan Gray after discovering *Kid Krow*, but this album cemented it.

# *Crush(ed)* by Katherine Li (2022)
This one was just too relatable as I returned to school in grade 11 and it was all "Happening Again" (my most-streamed song in 2023). It all worked out in the end though! ;) <3

# *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)* by Taylor Swift (2010 / 2023)
The Taylor's Version with my favourite vault tracks. I learned how to play the piano part to "When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)" and played it non-stop for months. Nostalgia for my summer of 2023: a vivid memory of a car trip late in the evening, the sun already down, driving home from a golf course.

# *GUTS* by Olivia Rodrigo (2023)
Beginning of grade 11, listening to *GUTS* for the first time on the way to school. Perfectly captures teenage angst after *SOUR*, but in a matured fashion. My favourites: "making the bed", "the grudge", "pretty isn't pretty", and "teenage dream". Special shoutouts to the singles "bad idea right?", "vampire", and "get him back!" for being amazing workout songs. I wish I'd been able to go to the *GUTS* tour... :')

# *Wishbone* by Conan Gray (2025)
Such a screamable album!! Conan's vocals are insane here—all these songs sound amazing and the high note in "Vodka Cranberry" is just unmatched. I got tickets for the Wishbone Tour in February 2026 and I'm so excited to finally watch Conan live!!!

# *A Matter of Time* by Laufey (2025)
*Tick, tock:* like clockwork, I was hypnotized by this album as soon as it was released. I saw this live on October 19th!!! Laufey is such an amazing live performer, the stage was so beautiful, and I got my first ever concert t-shirt! :D
