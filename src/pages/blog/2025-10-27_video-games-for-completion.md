# Overview

I'm one of those people who *has* to 100% video games in order for them to feel complete. My Steam library is even sorted into collections: "Completed", "In Progress", "Never Finishing" (I'm looking at you, Stardew Valley), and "Not Yet Started".

I also get scared very, very easily, so I naturally play cozy games! I generally enjoy completing puzzle games with good storylines, cooking and building games, or ones that I can play with my friends.

# My Favourites

## [*Overcooked! 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/)
Went through *so much* insanity trying to complete this game, and kept getting scolded by my parents for spending too much time playing video games instead of taking a break for my eyes. Thanks to my friends for carrying me throughout. Maybe one day we'll finally finish four stars on every level...!

## [*A Little to the Left*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1629520/A_Little_to_the_Left/)
I love this game so much!! Organizing all kinds of things and knickknacks into every sort of drawer you could imagine. It took a lot of work to get the 100 Daily Tidys completed, but luckily I finished during the end of summer / start of the school year in 2024!

## [*A Short Hike*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/)
Super aesthethic world with very quenching-looking water (any video game with really beautiful water reminds me of *Super Mario Odyssey*â€”I never played it, but I watched a lot of playthroughs on YouTube for some reason). The cutest characters and storyline as you slowly journey up the mountain.

## [*Assemble with Care*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202900/Assemble_with_Care/)
A short but really fun 3d puzzle game of assembling some broken objects. I really loved the art style in this one, and the cozy storyline was wonderful.

## [*Unpacking*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135690/Unpacking/)
This is a classic game at this point: unpack all the belongings into the different rooms, and repeat every time the character moves into a new apartment! It has a very wholesome storyline and I loved seeing the progression of items that they kept with them as they moved.

## [*Venba*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/)
A wholesome cooking game with a storyline following an Indian mom that touches on the immigrant experience in Canada and the difference in perspective between generations. I think the cooking mechanics were quite simple but fun, and the main feature here is the story.

## [*Sokobond Express*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701330/Sokobond_Express/)
Fun (also difficult) puzzle game involving chemical bonds! No actual chemistry knowledge required, but it is extra fun if you're a chem nerd (like Andrew and me). Not really a cozy game, just nerdy...

## [*A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/316610/A_Good_Snowman_Is_Hard_To_Build/)
Also not super cozyâ€”I would say it's a bit more on the spooky side. Really cool puzzle game about rolling snowballs of three sizes to get cute personalized snowmen!

## [*A Taste of the Past*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706930/A_Taste_of_the_Past/)
A very short free game involving Chinese cooking dishes and a sad but beautiful storyline. I kind of forgot what exactly I liked so much about it, but I know that I really loved it.

# Special Shoutouts

I haven't actually completed these games, but I love them too!

## [*The Sims 4*](https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4)
I have hundreds, if not thousands of hours in *The Sims 4*. I love this game so muchâ€”I got into it because of Sims YouTubers (shoutout to [lilsimsie](https://www.youtube.com/lilsimsie)!) and I just build houses upon houses to fulfill my childhood interior decorating dreams.

## [*Stardew Valley*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/)
I am truly awful at this game, but I love playing it with friends! (Shoutout to our farm animals that are named after periodic table elements and horses Ivy and Violet!)

## [*Papa's Freezeria Deluxe*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291760/Papas_Freezeria_Deluxe/)
My perfectionist tendencies shine here: I'm always aiming for 100% on every order. Also a huge throwback to Cool Math Games from elementary school. I miss Flash games. :') 

## [*Inbento*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1567440/inbento/)
Place the sushi pieces in the grid in the right order to finish with the correct bento box!

## [*Is This Seat Taken?*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/)
Still in progress, but a fun game having to place the (very picky) shapes into seats to fulfill all their requirements!

## [*Cosmic Express*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/583270/Cosmic_Express/)
I'm not good enough at puzzles for this... but I still enjoy drawing paths for the trains to appropriately pick up and drop off all the alien customers. I have to say though, I'm not as big of a fan of the aesthetics (not cozy enough for me!).

## [*Untitled Goose Game*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/837470/Untitled_Goose_Game/)
Cause chaos for humans, as a goose. Very good imitation of real-life Canadian geese.

As you can see, my 28 completed games out of 38 games total *probably* indicates some of my perfectionist tendencies...
