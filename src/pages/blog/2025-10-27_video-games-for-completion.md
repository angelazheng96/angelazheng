# Overview

I'm one of those people who *has* to 100% video games in order for them to feel complete. My Steam library is even sorted into collections: "Completed", "In Progress", "Never Finishing" (I'm looking at you, Stardew Valley), and "Not Yet Started".

I also get scared very, very easily, so I naturally play cozy games! I generally enjoy completing puzzle games with good storylines, cooking and building games, or ones that I can play with my friends.

# My Favourites

## Overcooked! 2
Went through *so much* insanity trying to complete this game, and kept getting scolded by my parents for spending too much time playing video games instead of taking a break for my eyes. Thanks to my friends for carrying me throughout. Maybe one day we'll finally finish four stars on every level...!

## A Little to the Left
I love this game so much!! Organizing all kinds of things and knickknacks into every sort of drawer.

## A Short Hike
Super aesthethic world with very quenching-looking water (it's like the water in Super Mario Odyssey). The cutest characters and storyline as you slowly journey up the mountain.

## Unpacking
This is a classic game at this point: unpack all the belongings into the different rooms, and repeat every time they move into a new apartment. It has a very wholesome storyline and I loved seeing the progression of items that they kept with them as they moved.

## Venba
A wholesome cooking game with a storyline following an Indian mom that touches on the immigrant experience in Canada and the difference in perspective between generations.

## Assemble with Care


## Sokobond Express


## A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build

## A Taste of the Past

# Special Shoutouts

## The Sims 4
## Stardew Valley
## Papa's Freezeria Deluxe
## Is This Seat Taken?

If you'd like to snoop around and see what else I play, here's my Steam profile. :)

As you can see, my 28 completed games out of 38 games total *probably* indicates some of my perfectionist tendencies...
