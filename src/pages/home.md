# Welcome to my personal website! 💐

Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Angela Zheng (she/her), a first-year Computer Science student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) (St. George), but I grew up in Ottawa. I'm currently involved in [UTMIST](https://www.utmist.ca/), [CSSU](https://www.cssu.ca/), [WISE](https://wise.skule.ca/), and [UTAT](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems) at U of T in a variety of roles. I'm also super interested in anything related to CS, math, stats, physics, astronomy, and the like!

# What else?

- A few of my high school extracurriculars: I used to be a [competitive figure skater](https://www.starlightsynchro.com/) (yay synchronized skating!), member of a [FIRST Robotics Competition team](https://www.eomrobotics.com/), and flute/piccolo player in my school's concert band.
- In my free time, I enjoy learning about random topics through YouTube rabbit holes, crocheting, reading books, baking, eating good food, drinking bubble tea, and taking pictures of sunsets... along with lots of other occasional hobbies! Or, in emoji format: 💐💫🍓🧋🍵⛸️🎼🌌🌅📸📚🎶🧶
- If you couldn't already tell, I like the colour purple a lot. :)
- My last name Zheng (郑) is pronounced more like "Juh-ng" than "Z-eh-ng", but I don't mind. It's also not the same as the much more common last name Zhang (张)!
- I like the number 12 a lot, so when I was creating my email, I tried to get angelazheng[multiple of 12]@gmail.com. All of them were taken until I got to 96, so clearly I have a very common name!
