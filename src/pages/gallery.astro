    <h1>Gallery</h1>

      Yay, you've found my Gallery! I often forget to include photography in any
      list of my hobbies, but I'm a very amateur photographer (as in, I use my
      phone camera exclusively). Here are some of my favourite photos that I've
      taken, mostly from various trips that I've gone on!

      To end off, here's a quotation written by Ann Liang that I really like:
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          And my heart swells at the silly, simple, human fact that when we
          stumble upon something beautiful, our first instinct is to show it to
          the people we love. It's what we do with pretty seashells on a beach,
          a radiant sunset, a rare bird flitting through the trees, a herd of
          wild horses grazing in the countryside. <i>Look</i>, we say, saving
          these little pieces of beauty for each other. <i>
            Do you see it too? Isn't the world such a strange, lovely,
            breathtaking place?</i
