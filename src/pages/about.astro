      <p>
        Hi - welcome to my personal website! I'm Angela Zheng, an incoming
        Computer Science student at the University of Toronto (St. George),
        originally from Ottawa. I'm passionate about creating useful software
        that will help improve our world, even if it's just a silly game that
        makes someone's day a bit better. I'm super interested in anything
        related to CS, math, stats, physics, astronomy, and the like!
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than this, I'm also a competitive figure skater and a former FRC
        and band kid. In my free time, I enjoy learning about random topics
        through YouTube rabbit holes, crocheting, reading books, and baking...
        along with lots of other occasional hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please feel free to connect with me through email or LinkedIn - I'd love
        to chat!
