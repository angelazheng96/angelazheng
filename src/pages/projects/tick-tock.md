# Overview

For years, I've been looking for a stopwatch/timer that is (1) simple, (2) pretty, and (3) ad-free, to use when studying, or doing anything really.

Then, when I needed just a few more hours for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Athena Award](https://athena.hackclub.com/), I remembered that I can just make a timer and stopwatch website myself, with the ability to customize it however I want!

# Development

After getting familiar with Astro and Tailwind CSS from working on my personal website, it was a lot less painful to get started. I struggled mostly with the timer code logic and how to best make the timer input feel intuitive and aesthetic at the same time. It's always interesting to see that very simple apps that we often take for granted, like a timer (that really only has 4 possible buttons—start, pause, resume, and reset), ends up requiring some thinking.

# Easter Eggs

I added a certain sound (*tick, tock...*) that plays when you hover over something on each page. 👀 Also, I just had to make a Laufey reference, because it matches perfectly (I still haven't gotten over the fact that I saw [A Matter of Time](https://open.spotify.com/album/6lauK4mNENDUMSoekDVDNG?si=uNobvqgjQUy7UJwkxqTqxw) live).
