# Overview

The 2024-2025 year was my fourth year on our school's [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/programs/frc/) [Team 7476](https://www.eomrobotics.com/)! With the theme of [Reefscape](https://www.firstinspires.org/resources/library/frc/season-materials?view=calendar) for the 2025 competition season, we built our beloved cube-shaped robot named SpongeBot SquareFrame. My main role was part of the software team!

All of our archived code is stored in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Earl-Of-March-FRC)â€”feel free to check it out!

# Software
We mainly used Java (with some Python for robot vision) with [WPILib](https://wpilib.org/), the standard FRC library.

A *lot* of learning took place this year, including improved autonomous control using closed-loop control systems (PID + Feedforward) to launch the Algae (turquoise balls) into the barge (the target) with the press of a button.

We were also able to (kinda) get the robot drive autonomously... although there were a few competition playoff matches that were interesting... (The robot may or may not have driven in the completely wrong direction... twice...)

# Testing, testing, and testing some more...
My biggest takeaway from four years of robotics: your code will never, ever, *ever* do what you expect the first time you run it. The real world has so many different variables to take into account, and working autonomous systems are *much* more impressive to me than they used to be.

# My 2025 Season Wrapped
- Spending 7 hours in a row in the cafeteria at Niagara doing data entry
- My first time working on alliance selection, since we werenâ€™t expecting to be in picking position and scrambled to make a pick list
- Winning two awards at district events (SpongeBot SquareFrame!!) ðŸ§½
- Playing Just Dance and Mario Kart, microwaving a rotisserie chicken, and other shenanigans in our hotel rooms
- I wasnâ€™t at DCMP in-person, but constantly checking the 8 Blue Alliance & Statbotics tabs open on my phone, watching the livestreams, lurking on Slack, and jumping up and down in celebration in the pit of Shrek: The Musical
- Being picked for Alliance 2, ending as Technology Division Finalists, setting the world record for the highest losing score, and our mentor winning the Woodie Flowers Finalist Award!!
- Qualifying for the FIRST World Championships!!! (even though we couldn't go)
- Creating so many traditions: making and handing out hundreds of sponge pins and hair ribbons, chanting SpongeBot SquareFrame, bringing endless scrolls or 49 scouting sheets taped together to alliance selection, etc... ðŸ¤©

# Conclusion
I'm very grateful to have taken part in this amazing experience! I've learned so much about robotics, collaboration, the software development process, project management, and more, from and with all the people on this team. ðŸ’—
