# Overview

Our task for our Grade 12 Computer Science summative project: find a client who needs some software, and make the software for them.

We talked to my previous English teacher, Ms. Veitch, who wanted us to make a sort of library website where students cam browse her classroom books in case they want to borrow them.

Special thanks to Jessica Tao for working on this with me! :D

# Development

After our initial meeting with Ms. Veitch, we decided to use Google Apps Script with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as our development platform, since Ms. Veitch already had an existing database of her books in Google Sheets.

After overcoming many obstacles over the span of two months, we were able to make a simple website allowing the user to search for books as well as filter and sort by title, author, genre, and collection.

# Deployment

Unfortunately, we never properly deployed the website to a memorable URL, because Ms. Veitch was (understandably) unwilling to buy a domain just for two students' CS project. One day, maybe I'll deploy it under a subdomain...
