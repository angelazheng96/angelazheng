# Overview

I've been meaning to build a personal website for such a long time, but never really got around to doing it until earlier this summer.

Thanks to Hack Club's Athena Award for providing incentives to finish and deploy my website on a deadline! My code is open-source (link is above).

# Development

While I've made quite a few projects with the standard HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I wanted to branch out and explore something that's just, well, better. I heard about Astro from my friends, then decided to add on Tailwind CSS!

I still have a lot to learn, but I'm happy with the way it looks right now. Contact me if you have any feedback. :)
