# Overview

I've been meaning to build a personal website for a very long time, but never really got around to doing it until earlier this summer.

Thanks to [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Athena Award](https://athena.hackclub.com/) for providing incentives to finish and deploy my website on a deadline! My code is [open source](https://github.com/angelazheng96/angelazheng).

# Development

While I've made quite a few projects with the standard HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I wanted to branch out and explore something that's more scalable. I heard about [Astro](https://astro.build/) from my friends, then decided to add on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)!

I still have a lot to learn, but I'm happy with the way it looks for now. Feel free to let me know if you have any feedback! :)
