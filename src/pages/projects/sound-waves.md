# Overview
As part of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Athena Award](https://athena.hackclub.com/), I followed the [Oscillart YSWS](https://oscillart.athena.hackclub.com/) ("You Ship, We Ship") to create a website where you can enter musical notes and watch them move across the canvas!

# Development
Sound Waves was built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It took me around 10 hours and was my first submitted project for the Athena Award. I totally was not procrastinating studying for my final high school exams by working on this...

After completing the main portion of the YSWS, I decided to add a bunch of extra features: a beautiful tri-colour gradient colour scheme, toggle between light and dark mode, ability to adjust the volume and note lengths, and choice of the shape of the wave. You can also record your songs and download them as a video!

My biggest difficulties were the volume control (because at first it would ***BLAST*** straight into your ears) and getting the wave to perfectly fill up the canvas after the full song (this took some math to figure out). Overall, it was a fun, quick project to get me started on the Athena Award!
