# Overview

My first hackathon: Hack Club's Scrapyard Ottawa! It was 24 hours and held in the lobby of the Nokia office in Kanata.

## "Build stupid stuff, win stupid prizes"
... was the theme of the hackathon.

## Here's the pitch:
What's the problem with mobile devices nowadays? We all get so many notifications each and every day that it's easy to miss one, forget about another, or get overwhelmed and ignore them altogether.

Well, fear not: whenever you receive a notification, this simple Android app sends you a friendly reminder in the form of a notification, *just so you know* that you got a new notification.

The best part? It has a delay of 2 seconds, so sometimes it even covers up your actual notification while you're reading it. :D

## Uh... what time is it again?
Another bonus feature: Just So You Know sends you reminders letting you know what time it is at very random times of day.

## Did I sleep?
I slept on the floor and managed to sleep for maybe 2 hours that night, although I was lying down for maybe 4. 

## Okay fine here's the serious stuff
We decided to branch into mobile development (ooh something new) just because this was the scrappiest idea that we could think of.

Thank you to Kale Wu and Andrew Zhang for being awesome teammates!

(It was also the one weekend we had free between FRC competitions at the end of March break. It's safe to say that we were all quite sleep-deprived and going insane.)

# Deployment

We built Just So You Know with Android Studio and Kotlin. It's not officially released anywhere, but you can download it for yourself [here](https://github.com/angelazheng96/just-so-you-know/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
