# Overview

My second hackathon: Hack Club's JPEG Ottawa! It was Ottawa's first all-girls hackathon, organized by a bunch of my friends (shoutout to them), and held at Carleton University for 25 hours.

Thank you to Bella Liu and Claire Zhong for being amazing!!! (And for dealing with me when I might have gotten a minor case of food poisoning...)

## RACCOONS... in Tim Hortons?
The theme of JPEG was, well, raccoons in Tim Hortons.

We took inspiration from this by making a game where you serve coffee and donuts to a variety of animal customers!

We chose to use the Unity game engine (which has code in C#). I was brand-new to Unity, but Claire had experience making games in it before, and Bella was our awesome artist.

## Did I sleep?
Nope, Claire and I pulled an all-nighter. We were very, very glad to be done when we finally deployed the game. I kept my pillow in front of me on our table as emotional support though.

# Development
WOW the amount issues we had... we had trouble with the layering of objects in the game (we should have closely read ChatGPT's instructions hours earlier), as well as the colour mixing for the coffee as you add more and more milk. We wanted to add a timer as well to add more stress, but we ran out of time.

However, I still learned a lot about Unity and it was fun to explore something so new to me! I had a great time with everyone there as well.

# Deployment
Feel free to play Tim Hortoons at the link above! There are some glitches but just like... ignore them please. :)
